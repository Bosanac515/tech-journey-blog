Understanding Poker Hand Rankings: Your Guide to Mastering the Game
Poker is a game of skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. One of the fundamental aspects of becoming a proficient poker player is understanding hand rankings. Knowing which hands outrank others can be the difference between a big win and a significant loss. In this blog post, we'll break down the best poker hand rankings to help you master the game and increase your chances of winning.

The Basics of Poker Hand Rankings
In poker, hands are ranked based on the probability of being dealt those hands in a standard 52-card deck. The rarer the hand, the higher its ranking. Here are the standard poker hand rankings from highest to lowest:

1. Royal Flush
Description: The highest possible hand in poker, the Royal Flush consists of the Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten, all of the same suit.

Example: A♠ K♠ Q♠ J♠ 10♠

2. Straight Flush
Description: Five consecutive cards of the same suit. If two players have a Straight Flush, the hand with the highest top card wins.

Example: 9♣ 8♣ 7♣ 6♣ 5♣

3. Four of a Kind
Description: Four cards of the same rank and one unrelated card. Also known as "quads."

Example: Q♠ Q♦ Q♣ Q♥ 3♠

4. Full House
Description: Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. In the event of a tie, the player with the higher three of a kind wins.

Example: K♣ K♦ K♠ 4♠ 4♣

5. Flush
Description: Five cards of the same suit, not in consecutive order. The highest card in the flush determines the winner in case of a tie.

Example: J♠ 8♠ 5♠ 3♠ 2♠

6. Straight
Description: Five consecutive cards of different suits. The highest card in the straight determines the winner in case of a tie.

Example: 10♠ 9♣ 8♦ 7♠ 6♥

7. Three of a Kind
Description: Three cards of the same rank and two unrelated side cards. Also known as "trips" or "set."

Example: 8♣ 8♦ 8♠ K♠ 3♥

8. Two Pair
Description: Two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and one unrelated card. The highest pair wins in case of a tie.

Example: 7♠ 7♦ 5♣ 5♠ 2♦

9. One Pair
Description: Two cards of the same rank and three unrelated side cards. The highest pair wins in case of a tie.

Example: 9♠ 9♥ A♣ J♠ 4♦

10. High Card
Description: If no player has any of the above hands, the hand with the highest card wins. If necessary, the second highest, third highest, and so on, can be used to break ties.

Example: A♠ 10♦ 7♣ 6♠ 2♥
